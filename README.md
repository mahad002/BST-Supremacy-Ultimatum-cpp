# BST-Supremacy-cpp
covering basic functions of a Binary Search Tree

You have seen the basic BST and its operations in the class lectures
Your first task is to augment this basic implementation with the following functions (or
functionalities):
    1.Print the elements in descending order
    2.isBST(node): A global (friend) function that checks if a tree (or subtree) is a BST (by
      returning a Boolean). You may have to include another function in the class to call this one with
      the treeâ€™s root.
    3.printLessThan(key): Prints all the elements in order that are less than the key. The key need
      not be in the tree.
    4. Overload the assignment operator for the Tree class. The new tree should have the same
      structure and contain elements in the similar order.
